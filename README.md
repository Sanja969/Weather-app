# Weather-app

A weather app that pulls from the OpenWeatherMap API to allow users to search for and view the forecast in cities worldwide. Built with JavaScript.


# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio. In the header, I got my logo, and links for my Twitter, Linkedin, Resume, and Blogs. 
I got some pictures of myself, and a big line about me in the headline.
I made a portfolio section where I made an app for posting all my portfolios. 
I post some of them, but in the future, I'm planning to post more of them, as I will improve some of my posted projects.
Also, I made a blog app, for posting blogs. When you click on the blog link in the header you will go to my blogs.

For design, I was using Bootstrap framework as of course CSS.
I was using Django and python for backend.
Beyond this, there are a lot of cool things about this website that are driven by databases. It is storing all information for my blogs and projects.
